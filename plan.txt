-> Create a scalable board. (Done)
-> Create circles in each coordinate of the board (matrix) (Done)
-> Make the circles clickable (Done)
 -they should change color when clicked. when clicked for the second time the default color should be applied
-> At first 20 goats should be placable whereever (given the circle is empty).
-> Turn should be changed after each move


-> Game and Winning Logic = ?
lets say all center coodrinates of the circle represent a mathematical matrix like aij

Centers Mapping -> (
    (0,0), (0,1), .....
    ...................
    ..
    ..

)





Final steps:
add sound to goat being killed
add animations of goat being killed


now make the tiger moveable
proper highlight Logic
